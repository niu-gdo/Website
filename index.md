## Fall 2024 Schedule
This semester will focus on game development core concepts. For people interested in the group project it will be taking a back seat until further notice, as we will be focusing on getting more people ready to work on it.  
  
The below schedule is subject to change, this should be used to get an idea of what our meeting will look like
